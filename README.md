EDIT: 
In this small exercise, I have demonstrated a few skills in HTML.
I have linked pages.
I have organized directories that holds all the data used. (images, and recipes)
I have demonstrated use of setting up initial structures of html code.
I have demonstrated use of headings, lists, paragraph, anchor, and image tags.
