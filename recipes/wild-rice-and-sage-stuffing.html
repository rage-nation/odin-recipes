    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup coarsely chopped walnuts</li>
        <li>8 slices whole-grain gluten-free bread, cut into 1/2-inch cubes</li>
        <li>4 1/2 Tbs. olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp. salt</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp. freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 large white onion, diced (2 cups)</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic minced (1 tsp.)</li>
        <li>4 cups low-sodium vegatable broth</li>
        <li>2 cups wild rice</li>
        <li>1 tsp. finely chopped fresh tarragon</li>
        <li>1 tsp. chopped fresh sage</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375°F. Coat 8-inch-square baking dish with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Toast walnuts in dry skillet over medium heat 5 minutes, or until fragrant, shaking skillet often. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Toss bread cubes with 21/2 Tbs. oil, salt, and pepper in bowl. Transfer to baking sheet, and bake 12 to 14 minutes, or until golden brown. Set aside, and keep oven on.</li>

Add broth, and bring to a boil. Stir in wild rice, and return to a boil. Cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer 40 minutes. Stir in toasted walnuts, and simmer, covered, 10 minutes more. Remove from heat, and season with salt and pepper, if desired.</li>
        <li>Spread in prepared baking dish, and bake 10 to 20 minutes, or until beginning to brown and crisp on top. Serve sprinkled with croutons, sage and tarragon.</li>
